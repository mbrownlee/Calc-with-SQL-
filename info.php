Changed: We're going to create a simple PHP calculator that saves all input values in a MySQL table. Aaron can create a small test DB We will have at least 3 pages:

1) Input page for adding "people" that can run calculations. 

2) Page for running calculations (Numeric entries, operator type, results, timestamp, etc) - person who is running the calculation should select their name from a drop down menu. This should be a required field. The calculation should display on the page and also store in a table along with a key that identifies the selected "person".

3) Page for viewing historical calculations (and name of person who ran them).


Extra challenges:
Fiddle around with making the results "pageable" (Ex - show 10 at time and scroll to the next ten)
Figure out how to sort and filter by date
Firgure out how to sort and filter by name
